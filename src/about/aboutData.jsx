      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>Back up your files.</li>
        <li>
          This app edits only character and inventory files. Other in-game
          values such as party location and mission status are stored elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pushing certain values too far will break the game, especially if the
          value depends on an AD&D reference table. For example, because character
          ability scores in AD&D max out at 18, if you give your character an 85
          charisma, weird stuff will happen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most of the values can't exceed 255, unless they're obviously meant to
          be large numbers, such as experience and wealth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain values - such as saving throws and thief skills - come
          directly from the AD&D tables and are determined by the character's
          level and modifiers. These values are set by the game automatically on
          load. So even though you can change them with this editor, the values will reset when the game starts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Where possible, the integer input fields have minimum and maximum
          values. But those are easy to get around, and it's your game to break.
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>Tips for editing characters</h4>
        <li>To make a character's strength 18(00), set it to 18(100).</li>

        <li>
          Although this editor provides checkboxes for cleric spells, there's no
          way assign a character a specific cleric spell. In AD&D, if a
          character has access to a clerical spell level, that character
          automatically knows all the spells of that level.
        </li>
        <li>
          Magic-user spells, however, can be assigned one-at-a-time. Which leads
          to:
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to give a non-magic-user character access to magic-user
          spells, you don't have to multi-class the character in the game.
          Simply use the editor to assign magic-user levels to that character.
          The game won't automatically change the character's class, but that
          character will be able to use magic-user spells.
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>Tips for editing inventory</h4>
        <li>
          Inventory items can't be named just any string of text. They must be
          renamed by selecting from the dropdown menus of pre-programmed
          descriptors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each item has three slots for special effects. For the most part these
          don't do anything, however:
        </li>
        <li>
          For wands, the "Effect1(charges)" field determines how many times the
          wand can be used before its magic is depleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          For scrolls, the "Effect1(charges)" field determines which spell the
          scroll contains. The spell is determined by an integer that will vary
          from game to game. Effect2 is the scroll's second spell and Effect3 is
          the third spell.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrows, darts and certain other items can be assigned an <em>ammo</em>{" "}
          number. This gives a single item multiple uses without taking up
          another inventory slot. This is not the same as duplicating an item.
          In other words, assigning ammo to a sword won't make multiple copies
          of that sword.
        </li>
      </ul>
